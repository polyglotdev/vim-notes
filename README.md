# Vim Notes

After a spiritied [back and forth](https://dominiquehallan-links.com/3XO6aIa) that started mildly contentious on my behalf with @TechDufus on X we came to few conclusions:

1. Both of our mothers are fantastic!
2. He was indeed trolling with the question that he asked.
3. Sarcasm is his love language.
4. I should jump to less conclusions about what happens on the a keyboard ðŸ˜‰
5. I am going to switch to Neovim for 60 days and ask all my dumb questions here!

We ended up having a great conversation on Zoom and it was all in good fun. Just goes to show you that good things do happen on X.

A little but more information on the Vim transition.

- I am going to use [AstroVim](https://dominiquehallan-links.com/4bhuq8N) because I still have to work and I think this gets me rocking on Neovim quickly instead of spending 16 hours a day playing with config files to even do basic things.
- I really am going to use AstroVim for something other than thing that pops up when I rebase code commits, so wish me luck!
